### Pokémon TCG Checklist
---

A simple HTML checklist for tracking cards from the Base, Jungle, and Fossil Pokémon TCG sets. Includes holo indicators, progress tracking.

---

## Overview
---

This is a single-page HTML checklist that lists every card in the three classic sets. You can tick off cards as you collect them, including holo versions. The page also shows your overall completion percentage.

The main reason this was made is so it can be saved to an iPhone home screen and used like a lightweight “app” when checking cards on the go.
